# Introduction

## Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, a comprehensive textbook designed to guide you through the fascinating world of modern robotics and artificial intelligence systems. This textbook is authored by **Maryam Siddiqui** and provides a structured approach to understanding the complex interplay between robotics, AI, and physical systems.

### What You'll Learn

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Explore the Robot Operating System and how it serves as the nervous system for robots, enabling communication, coordination, and control across complex robotic systems.

- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Discover how digital twins and simulation environments allow us to model, test, and validate robotic systems in virtual worlds before deploying them in the physical realm.

- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Investigate how artificial intelligence powers the cognitive capabilities of robots, enabling perception, decision-making, and learning.

- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Understand how robots integrate vision, language, and action to interact with humans and navigate complex environments.

### Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Computer science and engineering students
- Robotics researchers and practitioners
- AI developers interested in physical systems
- Anyone curious about the intersection of AI and robotics

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this textbook, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python and/or C++)
