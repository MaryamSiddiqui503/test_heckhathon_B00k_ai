# 1.1 Introduction to ROS 2: The Foundation of Robotic Systems

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)
- Explain the architecture and components of ROS 2
- Identify the differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2
- Recognize the role of ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of robotic systems
- Describe the core communication patterns in ROS 2

## Concept Explanation

### What is ROS 2?

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is not an actual operating system, but rather a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

ROS 2 serves as the communication backbone for robotic systems, enabling different components of a robot to work together seamlessly. It provides services such as hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries for implementing common robot functionality, message-passing between nodes, and package management.

### The Evolution from ROS 1 to ROS 2

ROS 2 was developed to address the limitations of the original ROS (ROS 1) and to meet the needs of commercial and industrial robotics applications. The key improvements in ROS 2 include:

1. **Real-time support**: ROS 2 provides better real-time capabilities, which are essential for safety-critical robotic applications.

2. **Multi-robot systems**: Enhanced support for multi-robot systems and distributed computing.

3. **Improved architecture**: Based on DDS (Data Distribution Service) for more robust communication.

4. **Security**: Built-in security features to protect robotic systems from cyber threats.

5. **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configurable policies for message delivery, reliability, and performance.

### Core Architecture Components

ROS 2 architecture consists of several key components:

#### Nodes
A node is a process that performs computation. In ROS 2, nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a robot application. Each node can perform specific tasks such as sensor data processing, control algorithms, or user interfaces.

#### Topics
Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. Topics implement a publish/subscribe communication pattern where multiple nodes can publish messages to a topic, and multiple nodes can subscribe to receive messages from a topic.

#### Services
Services provide a request/response communication pattern. A service client sends a request message and waits for a response from a service server. This is useful for operations that require a direct response.

#### Actions
Actions are a more advanced communication pattern that supports long-running tasks with feedback and goal management. They are particularly useful for navigation and manipulation tasks.

#### Parameters
Parameters are configuration values that can be set at runtime and shared between nodes. They provide a way to configure robot behavior without recompiling code.

## Practical Context (Robotics / Physical AI)

### ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System

The analogy of ROS 2 as a "nervous system" is particularly apt for understanding its role in robotics. Just as the nervous system in biological organisms transmits signals between different parts of the body, ROS 2 enables communication between different components of a robotic system.

In a humanoid robot, for example:
- Sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMU) publish data to topics
- Perception nodes process sensor data and publish results
- Planning nodes receive sensor data and publish commands
- Control nodes receive commands and send them to actuators
- All these components communicate through ROS 2, coordinated by the ROS 2 middleware

### Real-World Applications

ROS 2 is used in various robotics applications:
- Autonomous vehicles and mobile robots
- Industrial automation and manufacturing
- Service robots in healthcare and hospitality
- Research platforms in universities and labs
- Agricultural and construction robots

## Examples

### Basic ROS 2 Publisher Example

Here's a simple Python example of a ROS 2 publisher node:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalPublisher(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_publisher')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'topic', 10)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)
        self.i = 0

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello World: %d' % self.i
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info('Publishing: "%s"' % msg.data)
        self.i += 1

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_publisher = MinimalPublisher()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_publisher)
    minimal_publisher.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Basic ROS 2 Subscriber Example

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class MinimalSubscriber(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('minimal_subscriber')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String,
            'topic',
            self.listener_callback,
            10)
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

    def listener_callback(self, msg):
        self.get_logger().info('I heard: "%s"' % msg.data)

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    minimal_subscriber = MinimalSubscriber()
    rclpy.spin(minimal_subscriber)
    minimal_subscriber.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced ROS 2 as the foundational communication framework for robotic systems. We explored:

- The concept of ROS 2 as a flexible framework rather than an operating system
- The evolution from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and the key improvements
- The core architectural components: nodes, topics, services, actions, and parameters
- The practical application of ROS 2 as the "nervous system" of robotic systems
- Basic examples of ROS 2 publisher and subscriber nodes

ROS 2 provides the essential infrastructure that allows different components of a robot to communicate and coordinate effectively, forming the basis for more complex robotic behaviors and capabilities that we'll explore in subsequent chapters.
