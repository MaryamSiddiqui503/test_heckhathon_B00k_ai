## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains a **complete digital textbook** for the course  
**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**.

The book focuses on **Physical AI and embodied intelligence**, explaining how
artificial intelligence systems operate in the **physical world** through
humanoid robots. It bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical
bodies using modern robotics tools and simulations.

The textbook is created using **Spec-Driven Development** with **Spec-Kit Plus**
and authored using **Claude Code**.

- Single source of truth via:
  - `/sp.constitution.md`
  - `/sp.specify.md`
  - `/sp.plan.md`
  - `/sp.tasks.md`
  - `/sp.implement.md`

---

## 📖 References

All theoretical content is based on:
- Official ROS 2 documentation
- Gazebo and Unity documentation
- NVIDIA Isaac platform resources
- Academic literature on Physical AI and embodied intelligence

A complete references list is included within the book.
